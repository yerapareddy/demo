Thread.sleep() - java wait time



implicit wait - global wait time - this is applied for every step
		- lets say if you are giving wait time as 5 sec, but the element loaded in 3 sec but it will wait for 5 sec
explicit wait - this is applied for a particular element
		- lets say if you are giving wait time as 5 sec, but the element loaded in 3 sec so it will wait for only 3 secs
fluent wait - lets say if you are giving wait time as 10 sec, and if you are giving frequency as 2 sec , after every 2 sec it will look for the element
